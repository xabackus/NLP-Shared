Upload my datasets to your Google Drive

Run either the first or the second cell of the pipeline ipynb I created to fine-tune a model on my training and testing datasets.
First cell is for English, second cell is Spanish.
Make sure to change the hub id to your own repository and model name.

Run the third code cell if you want to test your model on specific pieces of text.

Run the fourth code cell to evaluate your model's performance against a testing dataset.
We cannot provide one for your because the dataset we used was somebody else's closed-source dataset.
If you wnat to, you can seek access to it from the creators of the EXIST dataset, and then preprocess the data to match how we preprocessed the training data.
